Mussels
Ingredients
Mussels {2 pounds}
White Wine {3/4 cup}
Red Pepper {1/2}
Garlic {1 clove}
Onion {1 medium}
Butter {2 tbsp}
Baguette
Preparation
Clean mussels thoroughly, don't put them in water as this will kill them. Make sure that they all are shut (tap on the shell if open, if it's alive it will close)
Dice onion, red pepper, and garlic
Heat pot/wok on medium high and saute onion and pepper in butter until translucent
Add garlic and saute until aromatic, about a half minute
Crank heat to high and add white wine and mussels
Cover and let steam until mussels open, about 5 or 6 minutes
Add some more butter if you want, and serve fresh with sliced baguette
Notes
Buy the freshest mussels available, from a dependable fish market
Throw out any with cracked shells, or those that won't close
When cleaning, do your best to debeard the things
